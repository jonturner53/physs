Notes for installing the physs software on a new BeagleBone

First, install the proper version of the BeagleBone OS
(debian 10.3, 2020-04-06)

ssh debian@192.168.7.2 (password temppwd)

# setup standard user accounts
sudo su
adduser guru (name it Adminstrative account)
usermod -aG sudo guru (give sudo privileges to guru)
exit
logout

ssh guru@192.168.7.2
mkdir .ssh
chmod 700 .ssh
cat /dev/null >.ssh/authorized_keys
vi .ssh/authorized_keys
	#add public keys for all sys admins
chmod 644 .ssh/authorized_keys

# disable debian account and change root password
sudo su
usermod --lock --expiredate 1970-01-02 debian
passwd <secureRootPassword>

# create physs directory, download code and install
cd /usr/local
git clone https://bitbucket.org/MoteOceanTechnology/physs
cd physs/install
./install1

vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config (change Port 22 to 28202)
systemctl restart ssh
# in separate window on laptop, type
ssh fizz (to verify that key-based login to guru works)
# transfer a copy of /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub version into
# coolcloud:~fizz/.ssh/authorized_keys
ssh coolcloud (login to verify key, accept cert and logout)

./install2

reboot

# To configure with a specific serial number (not 99)
# Edit coolcloud:~fizz/.ssh/authorized_keys, replacing comment
#   "Physs 99 ..." at the end of the line for this physs with
#   "Physs sn" where sn is new serial number;
#   edit /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub entry to match
# then, login to coolcloud and type nextRecord sn
#   where sn is desired serial number; the output is
#   the record number of the next valid record for the
#   specified serial number
# then, login to console for new beaglebone and type
#   "changeSerialNumber sn nr" where nr is the record number
#   obtained in previous step
# then, type reboot in the console
