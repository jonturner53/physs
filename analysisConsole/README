This directory implements the fizz analysis console.
This consists of two parts, a server that runs on the fizz
and a user interface that runs in the user's browser.
These communicate using commands encoded in get requests.

The server is in server.js and is runs under node.js.
It uses the Express web application framework.
Static resources (html, images, javascript files)
are in the static directory. The file static/index.html
is the top level of the console user interface code.

The modeLibs directory contains the mode libraries
(classic, standard, experimental).
