This directory contains a utility that issues email alerts when
newly acquired physs data shows elevated sim index values for
karenia brevis. The program sender.js implements the utility and
is called once a day by the cron daemon. Actually, the cron
daemon invokes the sender shell script which runs "node sender.js".

The recipients file contains a list of email addresses for those
people who are to receive alert messages. Sender.js maintains
an alertStatus file for each physs. This is stored in the
physs's data directory and allows sender to keep track of which
records have already been processed.
